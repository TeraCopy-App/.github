## ‚ö° Overview  

TeraCopy is a specialized file management utility designed to optimize the process of copying and moving files on Windows. Unlike the standard system tools, it ensures high-speed performance with error recovery and detailed reporting, making it an essential tool for anyone handling large volumes of data.  

The program minimizes transfer interruptions by retrying problematic files and skipping damaged ones without stopping the entire operation. It also offers real-time verification, ensuring that each copied file matches the original, thus protecting data integrity.  

With its clean and intuitive interface, TeraCopy can seamlessly integrate into Windows Explorer, replacing the default copy dialog. This makes it easier for users to pause, resume, or manage ongoing transfers without disruptions.  

TeraCopy Pro extends the feature set with advanced capabilities, including file selection filters, advanced reporting, and enhanced error handling. This makes it particularly useful for IT professionals, system administrators, and power users managing large-scale file operations.
